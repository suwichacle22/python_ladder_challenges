Our class moves quickly! Sometimes, it feels like we make leaps in logic that are a bit too big. Learn Python slowly, by doing many, many examples. Problems in this notebook start out easy and progressively get harder. The order of the problems is designed so that the next rung of the Python ladder is always within reach. If you get stuck, look at your answers to previous problems and see if you can use that logic to solve the next problem.

## Contents
This repository contains three notebooks, separated only so they do not get too long. The content is divided into 8 sections and are designed to be completed in order. Do not skip!

| File | Section | Contents |
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | I | Numbers, variables, and math |
| 1 | II | Strings |
| 1 | III | Lists | 
| 2 | IV | Conditionals and loops |
| 2 | V | List comprehensions |
| 2 | VI | Libraries, imports, and some more math! |
| 3 | VII | Functions |
| 3 | VIII | What's next? |

We encourage the use of Googling to aid you in solving these problems\*! That's how the pros do it!

\* That is, Googling _how_ to solve a problem. Not Googling solutions to problems.
